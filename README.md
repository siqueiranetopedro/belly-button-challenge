ABOUT
In this project, I construct an interactive dashboard designed to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which meticulously documents the microbial communities inhabiting human navels. This dataset unveils intriguing insights, indicating that a select few microbial species, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study, are prevalent in over 70% of individuals, with the remaining species being comparatively rare. The interactive dashboard will serve as a user-friendly platform to delve into this fascinating dataset and gain a deeper understanding of the diverse microbial life found in human navels.

TOOLS
Jarvis scriptâ€¨
D3 Library

PROCESS
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.


In the realm of data visualization using JavaScript, the utilization of 3D libraries can significantly enhance the process of extracting information and constructing immersive charts. Leveraging these libraries, empowers developers to create dynamic and visually compelling bar and bubble charts. By incorporating three-dimensional elements, data points can be represented with depth and perspective, offering a more engaging and intuitive experience for users. These libraries provide a robust set of tools to handle complex geometries, lighting effects, and camera interactions, allowing for the creation of interactive charts that transcend the limitations of traditional two-dimensional visualizations. This innovative approach not only improves the clarity of data representation but also adds a layer of sophistication to the overall user interface, enhancing the impact and accessibility of the presented information.
